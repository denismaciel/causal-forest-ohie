Pre-question                            We've talked about the medical care you've received in the last 12 months. Now I'd like to figure out how much it cost you to
                                        get that care. When we talk about your costs, I'm thinking about money you have paid yourself, out of your own pocket, or
                                        that friends or relatives have helped you pay. I'm not including money that an insurance company or some other organization
                                        paid on your behalf. I'm also not including money that you owe or that you put on your credit card, but haven't paid yet -- I'll
                                        ask about that later. Also, as usual, I'm not including dental or routine vision care
Literal question                        Q150. In the last 12 months, about how many times have you seen a doctor or other health care professional at a
                                        doctor's office, a clinic, or at home? Iâ€™m thinking of regular doctor visits, not hospital stays, emergency room visits,
                                        surgery, or dental care -- Iâ€™ll ask about those later.
                                        Q151. If you were giving your best guess, would you say it was...

Pre-question                            We've talked about the medical care you've received in the last 12 months. Now I'd like to figure out how much it cost you to
                                        get that care. When we talk about your costs, I'm thinking about money you have paid yourself, out of your own pocket, or
                                        that friends or relatives have helped you pay. I'm not including money that an insurance company or some other organization
                                        paid on your behalf. I'm also not including money that you owe or that you put on your credit card, but haven't paid yet -- I'll
                                        ask about that later. Also, as usual, I'm not including dental or routine vision care

Pre-question                            For this part of the physical exam, I will take your pulse and your blood pressure with this Omron machine. The machine
                                        will take 3 blood pressure measurements. There will be a 30 second resting period between the measurements. When the
                                        machine inflates the cuff, it may feel tight and you will feel some pressure. While the machine is taking your blood pressure,
                                        I ask that you not talk or move and I will not talk either. Talking and moving can change your blood pressure. Before taking
                                        your blood pressure reading, there is going to be a 5 minute waiting period. I would like for you to sit down comfortably and
                                        quietly for those 5 minutes. At the four minute mark, I will take your pulse.
                                        I will give you your results at the end of the exam.

Pre-question                            For this part of the physical exam, I will take your pulse and your blood pressure with this Omron machine. The machine
                                        will take 3 blood pressure measurements. There will be a 30 second resting period between the measurements. When the
                                        machine inflates the cuff, it may feel tight and you will feel some pressure. While the machine is taking your blood pressure,
                                        I ask that you not talk or move and I will not talk either. Talking and moving can change your blood pressure. Before taking
                                        your blood pressure reading, there is going to be a 5 minute waiting period. I would like for you to sit down comfortably and
                                        quietly for those 5 minutes. At the four minute mark, I will take your pulse.
                                        I will give you your results at the end of the exam.
                                        Do you have any questions?
