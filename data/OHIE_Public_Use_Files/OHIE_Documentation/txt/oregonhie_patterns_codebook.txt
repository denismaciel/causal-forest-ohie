                   Codebook: Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, Patterns Variables
This codebook lists all of the publicly available descriptive, emergency department, in-person survey, and
Medicaid enrollment variables that are necessary to replicate the results presented in "The Effect of Medicaid
Coverage on ED Use -- Further Evidence from Oregon's Experiment" by Finkelstein et al. (2016) (for data
sources, please see the User Guide). The codebook has two sections. In the first section, variable name, label,
and number of non-missing values are given. Where applicable, the text of the survey question and/or notes on
variable construction are given immediately following the variable. In the second section, variable name, label,
and any relevant survey question text are given along with descriptive statistics.

(inclusive). It is otherwise equal to zero. This variable is measured from a date range that is slightly different
from what is being used for the pre-randomization indicator for any ED visit ("any_visit_pre_ed") in the
previously resleased ED public use data set.

in any Medicaid program (including the lotteried program, OHP Standard) between the earliest notification date
in the sample (10 March 2008) and the in-person interview date. This variable was used as the definition of
insurance coverage in estimating the effect of Medicaid in the joint outcomes analysis.

# doc_any_incl_probe_inp:                     Any doctor visits in the past 12 months (In-person Survey)

Pre-question                            We've talked about the medical care you've received in the last 12 months. Now I'd like to figure out how much it cost you to
                                        get that care. When we talk about your costs, I'm thinking about money you have paid yourself, out of your own pocket, or
                                        that friends or relatives have helped you pay. I'm not including money that an insurance company or some other organization
                                        paid on your behalf. I'm also not including money that you owe or that you put on your credit card, but haven't paid yet -- I'll
                                        ask about that later. Also, as usual, I'm not including dental or routine vision care
Literal question                        Q150. In the last 12 months, about how many times have you seen a doctor or other health care professional at a
                                        doctor's office, a clinic, or at home? I'm thinking of regular doctor visits, not hospital stays, emergency room visits,
                                        surgery, or dental care -- I'll ask about those later.
                                        Q151. If you were giving your best guess, would you say it was...
                                        -Zero times
                                        -Once, OR
