        Codebook: Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, Emergency Department Variables
This codebook lists all of the publicly available emergency department variables from the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment (for data sources, please see the User Guide). The codebook has two sections. In the first
section, variable name, label, and number of non-missing values are given. Where applicable, the text of the
survey question and/or notes on variable construction are given immediately following the variable. In the second
section, variable name, label, and any relevant survey question text are given along with descriptive statistics.
