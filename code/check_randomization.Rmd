We only got data on hospital vistis about 24646 participants.

```{r}
nrow(descriptive); nrow(state_programs); nrow(survey12); nrow(emergency)
```

Keep only patients who live in the region we have data on emergency department vistis.

```{r}
descriptive_reduced <- descriptive %>% 
  filter(person_id %in% emergency$person_id)

## Comparison of statistics between treatment and control groups

Year of Birth

```{r}
yob <- descriptive_reduced %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(key = mean(birthyear_list),
            metric = "year_of_birth") %>% 
  spread(treatment, key)

yob
```

Percentage of Female
```{r}
pp_female <- descriptive_reduced %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(key = sum(female_list == "1: Female", na.rm = TRUE)/n()) %>% 
  mutate(metric = "pp_female") %>% 
  spread(treatment, key)

pp_female
```

Provided Phone Number
```{r}
gave_phone_number <- descriptive_reduced %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(key = 1 - sum(have_phone_list == "Did NOT give phone number", na.rm = TRUE) / n()) %>% 
  mutate(metric = "gave_phone_number") %>% 
  spread(treatment, key)

gave_phone_number
```

Signed Up for the first day of lottery

```{r}
first_day <- descriptive_reduced %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(key = sum(first_day_list == "Signed up for lottery list on first day", na.rm = TRUE) / n()) %>% 
  mutate(metric = "first_day_list") %>% 
  spread(treatment, key)

first_day
```

## Combined

```{r}
all <- bind_rows(
  yob, pp_female, gave_phone_number, first_day
) %>% 
  mutate(diff = `Not selected` - Selected)

all
```


```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::knit_exit()
```


```{r}
